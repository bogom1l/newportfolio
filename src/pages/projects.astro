        <!-- Bio / Description -->
        <p class="mb-6">
          Alfred Wayne is a distinguished litigator specializing in complex
          litigation across both state and federal courts in Gotham City. Alfred
          began his illustrious career as a prosecutor in the Gotham District
          Attorney's Office, serving with distinction for 15 years before
          establishing his own firm, Wayne & Associates, in 2018. Throughout his
          career, he has presided over numerous high-profile cases and managed
          appeals that have tested even the most seasoned legal minds in the
          city. Beyond traditional litigation, Alfred also offers strategic
          counsel to major corporations and nonprofit organizations, often
          advising on matters where the interests of Gotham’s citizens—and its
          darker underbelly—intersect. Admitted to the Gotham Bar in 2002 and
          later to the New Jersey Bar in 2010, Alfred’s practice spans internal
          corporate investigations, white-collar criminal defense, and complex
          civil litigation, as well as administrative proceedings before
          Gotham’s regulatory bodies. His extensive experience in prosecuting
          and defending cases related to organized crime, financial fraud, and
          asset recovery has solidified his reputation as a pillar of Gotham’s
          legal community. During his tenure with the Gotham DA’s Office, Alfred
          was a frequent lecturer on the intricacies of corporate fraud and
          organized crime, delivering seminars at the city’s premier legal
          training facilities. He also played a key role in managing asset
          forfeiture and money laundering cases that targeted some of Gotham’s
          most notorious criminal networks. In addition to his legal practice,
          Alfred imparts his vast knowledge as a visiting professor at Gotham
          University School of Law, mentoring the next generation of legal
          professionals dedicated to upholding justice in a city that never
          sleeps.
